# AnimationKit — Status Report

- Timestamp (UTC): 2025-10-08T18:11:10Z
- Branch: work
- HEAD: 58cca59a1ab6ad1928bf8239205d03904dfbb1b5

## Summary
- Core animation DSL is expressed as an enum tree with clips, groups, and sequences, providing deterministic evaluation helpers and builder conveniences for composing animations.
- Beat-domain timing utilities and MIDI 2.0 automation timelines translate to wall-clock coordinates and feed back into the DSL, keeping experimental clocking behind a flag.
- The client façade layers typed errors, configurable retry/backoff, and lightweight monitoring over the generated OpenAPI client while exposing health, evaluation, submission, and CRUD endpoints.
- Serialization utilities bridge DSL clips and transport schemas, enforcing MIDI timelines on submission and covering draft/resource shapes with unit tests.
- Cross-platform CI targets macOS 14 (Xcode 16.2) and Linux (Swift 6.0 container), running build and test workflows on pushes and pull requests.

## Repository Structure & Assets
- SwiftPM manifest pins Apple OpenAPI packages and wires the generator plugin into the client target with the canonical `openapi.yaml` resource.
- Core sources live under `Sources/AnimationKit`, client façade code under `Sources/AnimationKitClient`, and corresponding tests under `Tests/AnimationKitTests` and `Tests/AnimationKitClientTests`.
- Documentation includes repo and feature guides plus the evolving release plan and changelog housed under `docs/`.

## Recent Audit Highlights
- MIDI-aware evaluation extends throughout the stack: `AnimationClip` normalizes duration to MIDI automation, and `Midi2Timeline` maps beat automation to parameter states.
- Client serialization intentionally rejects composite animations and clips without MIDI timelines, preventing transport drift.
- Golden-style tests assert transport encoding/decoding symmetry for animations, drafts, and evaluation batches.

## Risks & Follow-Ups
- Transport layer cannot yet submit grouped or sequenced animations; serialization throws `unsupportedComposition`.
- Submission also requires every clip to include a MIDI timeline, limiting use cases that rely solely on wall-time timelines.
- Examples remain placeholders and developer onboarding lacks a concrete walkthrough.
- Documentation and lint tooling are not enforced in CI; no doc coverage or style checks accompany the build matrix.

## Next Steps
- Implement serialization strategies (or fallback transports) for grouped/sequenced animations and wall-time-only clips to unlock broader DSL coverage.
- Flesh out end-to-end examples demonstrating DSL composition, evaluation, and client submission flows.
- Add quality gates—coverage thresholds, lint/format checks, and doc coverage verification—to the CI workflows ahead of the release candidate.
- Track outstanding release deliverables in the refreshed release plan and execute the publication checklist.
