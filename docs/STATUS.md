# AnimationKit — Status Report

- Timestamp (UTC): 2025-10-08T16:04:06Z
- Branch: main
- HEAD: <pending>

## Summary
- SwiftPM manifest updated to the latest Apple Swift OpenAPI packages (`swift-openapi-generator` 1.10.3, runtime 1.8.3, URLSession 1.2.0).
- Core DSL exposes documented public API covering keyframes, timelines, clips, groups, and sequences with deterministic evaluation.
- Beat-based time model (`BeatTimeModel`, `BeatTimeline`) converts between beats and wall-clock seconds with an opt-in MIDI 2.0 clock flag.
- Client façade now provides typed errors, retry/backoff controls, monitoring hooks, and new endpoints for listing, fetching, updating, and bulk-evaluating animations.
- Serialization utilities bridge between transport schemas and DSL types (drafts, resources, bulk evaluation samples) with golden tests.

## Structure
- Manifest: Package.swift
- Core DSL: Sources/AnimationKit (Animation.swift, Timeline.swift, Keyframe.swift, Parameters.swift, BeatTime.swift)
- Client façade: Sources/AnimationKitClient/ServiceClient.swift (typed errors, retry policy, monitoring hooks)
- Serialization: Sources/AnimationKitClient/Serialization.swift (bidirectional codecs, transport models)
- Tests:
  - Tests/AnimationKitTests/TimelineTests.swift
  - Tests/AnimationKitTests/AnimationCompositionTests.swift
  - Tests/AnimationKitTests/BeatTimeTests.swift
  - Tests/AnimationKitClientTests/ClientTests.swift
  - Tests/AnimationKitClientTests/SerializationTests.swift
- Docs: README.md, docs/README.md, docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md, docs/CHANGELOG.md (new)

## Decisions
- Treat complex animation structures as an enum tree (`Animation.clip/group/sequence`) to keep evaluation deterministic and extensible.
- Restrict client serialization to primitive clips until composite transport formats are defined, surfacing a specific error otherwise.
- Represent beat-driven timing with explicit models to enable future MIDI 2.0 clock integration without runtime globals.

## Open Items / Next Steps
- Add examples and documentation walkthroughs once DSL stabilizes further.
- Wire CI, linting, and doc coverage tooling (Milestone 3).
- Increase test coverage for complex client serialization and DSL evaluation (Milestone 3).

## Housekeeping
- `references/` remains ignored for external repositories.
- Generated OpenAPI sources stay out of version control; plugin runs at build time.
- Conventional commits remain the default workflow.
